			p Are.na is a flexible platform for private and collaborative research, designed to support arbitrary applications.
			p We like to think of Are.na as an evolving archive where people collaboratively create ideas over time by combining found and original material.
			p Are.na is also regularly adopted by professionals to research and organize projects. Brick-and-mortar shops use it to manage inventory, art institutions use it to curate exhibitions, creative teams use it to share inspiration, and academics use it to collect references.
			p	Users have created 23,591 channels and connected 302,047 blocks.

			h2.static--title--top#faq FAQs
			strong What should I use Are.na for? Why should I use it instead of other bookmarking and organization tools?

			strong Can someone else moderate or modify my channels?
