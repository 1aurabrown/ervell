    h1.static--hint About
    p Are.na is an evolving archive of private/public collaborative research.
    p Users can organically build ideas over time by adding images, links, files, texts (called blocks) and organize them into collections (called channels).
    p It's intended for pretty much any purpose. For example:
    h1
      li Academics use it to collect references.
      li Art institutions use it to curate exhibitions.
      li Creative teams use it to share inspiration.

    h1.static--hint Principles
    p We value transparency and we aim at being self-sustainable. We will never sell data without explicit authorization from the user. We will never display ads or join an ad network, and we're committed to retain complete control of the platform.
    p For our long-term plans we rely on our premium users who have access to a #[a(href="/tools/premium") growing series of extra features] for a yearly subscription.
