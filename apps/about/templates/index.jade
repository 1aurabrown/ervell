      p Are.na is a flexible platform for private and collaborative research.
      p We like to think of Are.na as an evolving archive where people collaboratively build up their ideas over time by combining found and original material.
      p There are no limitations on the subject or scope of an idea, Arena is intended to be used for pretty much any purpose.
      img.static__img(src="../images/arena-screenshot.jpg", alt="Arena")
      p Are.na is also regularly utilized by professionals to research and organize projects. Brick-and-mortar shops use it to manage inventory, art institutions use it to curate exhibitions, creative teams use it to share inspiration, and academics use it to collect references.
      p Users have created 23,591 channels and connected 302,047 blocks.
