			|	We built Arena in response to feeling overwhelmed by the mass of information presented to us daily on the Internet. We wanted a tool that could help us collect and sort information as it appears. Arena enables you to build ideas over time using any content you add or come across online. We like to think of Arena as an evolving archive where people collaboratively create new concepts by combining found and original material.
			br
			br
			|	Arena's users created 430'939 channels and connected 2'231'663 blocks of information.

			| We aim at being self-sustainable working to perfectionate and evolve the current product rather than seeking external funding. We offer advanced tools for a fair price so that people who use Are.na every day can contribute to the project's long-term plans.  
			br
			br
			|	To cover our present costs, maintenance and development we need 295 premium users per year. The current number is xx. You can see our premium options in the 
			a(href="#") tools page.
			br
			br
			| We also aim at transparency and trust towards our users: we will never sell data without explicit autorization from the user, we will never use advertisment as revenue model.
