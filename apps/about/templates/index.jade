			|	Are.na is a flexible platform for private and collaborative research, designed to support arbitrary applications.
			br
			br
			|	We like to think of Arena as an evolving archive where people collaboratively create ideas over time by combining found and original material.
			br
			br
			| Arena is also regularly adopted by professionals to research and organize projects. Brick-and-mortar shops use it to manage inventory, art institutions use it to curate exhibitions, creative teams use it to share inspiration, and academics use it to collect references.
			br
			br
			|	Users have created 430'939 channels and connected 2'231'663 blocks.

			.static--title--top#principles Principles
			| We aim at being self-sustainable working to perfectionate and evolve the current product rather than seeking external funding. 
			br
			br
			|	We offer advanced tools for a fair price so that people who use Are.na every day can contribute to the project's long-term plans. To cover our present costs, maintenance and development we need 295 premium users per year. The current number is xx. You can see our premium options in the 
			a(href="#") tools page.
			br
			br
			| We also value transparency: we will never sell data without explicit autorization from the user, we will never use advertisment as revenue model and we're committed to retain complete control of the platform.
