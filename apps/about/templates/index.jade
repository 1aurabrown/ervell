			.static--title--top#about-arena About
			|	Are.na is a flexible platform for private and collaborative research, designed to support arbitrary applications.
			br
			br
			|	We like to think of Are.na as an evolving archive where people collaboratively create ideas over time by combining found and original material.
			br
			br
			| Are.na is also regularly adopted by professionals to research and organize projects. Brick-and-mortar shops use it to manage inventory, art institutions use it to curate exhibitions, creative teams use it to share inspiration, and academics use it to collect references.
			br
			br
			|	Users have created 19,971 channels and connected 302,047 blocks.

			br

			br
			br
			strong What's the difference between public, closed and private channels?
			br
			| Channels have privacy settings that determine who can view or add to them. When creating a channel, you will be prompted to choose your privacy settings. 
			br
			| You can make a channel open, which means that anyone can add to and view the channel; private so only you and your collaborators can add to and view it; or closed so that only you and your collaborators can add to it, but everyone can view it.
			br
			br
			strong Can someone else moderate or modify my channels?
			br
			| Only contributors can delete blocks, anyone can add blocks on public and closed channels.
			br
			br
			strong What is a bookmarklet?
			br
			| Are.na's bookmarklet allows you to add information from your browser bar while you are out and about surfing the net. You can install it in one step
