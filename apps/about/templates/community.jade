      | Are.na is an open-ended platform adaptable to different needs and styles of use. Thereâ€™s no single correct way to use Are.na, nor to be a part of its community. These guidelines are intended to protect Are.na members from harmful behavior without undue restrictions on the types of content and behavior allowed on the platform.

    p.Type.Type--lg.Type--lh-tall
      | A number of members have put together channels sharing Are.na <strong><a href="https://www.are.na/alex-singh/how-do-you-use-are-na">use cases</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.are.na/zach-rose/are-na-meetups">meetups</a></strong>, <strong><a href="">collections</a></strong>, and discussions of <strong><a href="https://www.are.na/sam-hart/meta-are-na">all things Are.na</a></strong>. We also provide an official channel for <strong><a href="https://www.are.na/are-na/feedback-and-feature-requests">Feedback and Feature Requests</a></strong>. See our <strong><a href="https://www.are.na/terms">Terms of Use</a></strong> for more detailed legal clarification of content and use violations.

However, only cases of involuntary pornography, or of sexual content involving minors, will be moderated by the Are.na staff for removal. To report violations, email help@are.na and specify the offending user/s or content.

If you believe your account has been unfairly suspended, or your content erroneously removed, contact the help@are.na email to appeal.
